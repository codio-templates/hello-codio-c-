## Standard Code Test

Write a program that takes an integer from the user. Return the number multiplied by three. If the user enters a non-integer data type, return the following message:

`Please enter an integer`

**Note**, it is important that there is no string prompting the user to input a number. The string will cause the code test to fail.

<details><summary>**Adding the Terminal**</summary>You can add the terminal to the `TRY IT` button by changing the markdown code to `{try it|terminal}(python3 code_test.py)`. To add a terminal to the UI, click on the gear icon, and select "3 Panels without tree" as the layout. Then click on "Open tabs" and add a tab. Select "Terminal" as the type, and set the panel to 1. If you do not add a terminal to the UI, Codio will open one automatically in the same panel as the Python code. The terminal will be in a separate tab from the code.</details>
